# Timothy Lutheran Church Website — Project Context

This file captures the full project context so any Claude session can be resumed immediately.

---

## Project Overview

The Timothy Lutheran Church website (timothystl.org) is live on Cloudflare Workers. DNS cutover is complete as of April 2026. The site replaced the previous Tithely/Breeze-hosted site.

**Repo:** `timothystl/website`
**Primary branch for development:** `main` (deploys to timothystl.org, admin.timothystl.org, and all subdomain workers)

> **Note:** Admin portal changes (`tlc-admin-worker.js`) should be committed and pushed to `main` — the test site does not run the admin worker. Always target `main` for admin work.

---

## Architecture

### Live Workers (Production)
| Worker | Domain | File |
|--------|--------|------|
| timothystl-site | timothystl.org | `public/index.html` (SPA) |
| tlc-newsletter-admin | admin.timothystl.org | `tlc-admin-worker.js` |
| tlc-links | links.timothystl.org | `tlc-links-worker.js` |
| tlc-chms | volunteer.timothystl.org | `tlc-volunteer-worker.js` |

### Databases (Cloudflare D1)
- `tlc-newsletter-db` — tables: `newsletters`, `events`, (planned: `news_items`, `youth_pages`)
- `tlc-volunteer-db` — tables: `serve_events`, `serve_roles`, `signups`, `signup_slots`
- `RSVP_STORE` — Cloudflare KV namespace

### Auth
- Admin password: stored in Cloudflare Worker secret — do not commit here

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS, single-page SPA (`public/index.html`)
- **Backend:** Cloudflare Workers + D1 (SQLite) + KV
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- **Newsletter:** Brevo email sending + website archive (Beehiiv removed)
- **Calendar:** Google Calendar RSS embed at `/calendar`
- **Giving:** Tithely (`give.tithe.ly`) — displayed on site and in emails. Breeze is still used internally for people management and automated giving (some members have recurring giving set up via their bank to Breeze). Tithely and Breeze are the same company so this coexistence is not an issue. Do not prompt to "cancel Breeze."
- **Volunteer signups:** Separate worker at volunteer.timothystl.org (already complete)

## Admin Portal Plan (`admin.timothystl.org`)

Extend current `tlc-admin-worker.js` with new tabs:

| Tab | Who Uses It | Status |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| Newsletter | Pastor/office | **DONE** — format picker, Brevo email, draft/published split |
| News & Events | Pastor/office | **DONE** — DB wired, API live at /api/news |
| Ministries | Office staff | **DONE** — ministry page content management |
| Youth Pages | Youth director | **DONE** — TinyMCE editor, youth_pages DB table live |
| Scheduler | Link to volunteer scheduler | **DONE** — external link tab |
| Volunteer Admin | Link to volunteer.timothystl.org/admin | **DONE** — external link tab |
| Special Pages (`/voters`) | Office staff | **DONE** — Zoom link + file upload, admin-managed |
| Gym Rentals | Office staff (Dinger) | **DONE** — full rental management at /gym-rentals |

### News & Events Data Model
```sql
CREATE TABLE news_items (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  summary TEXT,           -- short text shown on card
  body TEXT,              -- full content shown on "Read More"
  image_url TEXT,
  publish_date TEXT,
  expire_date TEXT,       -- auto-hide after this date (default: 90 days out)
  pinned INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

### Youth Pages Data Model
```sql
CREATE TABLE youth_pages (
  slug TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- 'youth', 'sundayschool', 'vbs', etc.
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT,           -- HTML from WYSIWYG editor
  updated_at TEXT
);
```

### Gym Rentals Data Model
```sql
CREATE TABLE gym_groups (id, name, contact, email, phone, notes, access_token, max_active_holds, active);
CREATE TABLE gym_bookings (id, group_id, booking_date, start_time, end_time, notes, status, hold_expires_at, recurrence_id, created_by, created_at);
  -- status: 'hold' | 'confirmed' | 'released' | 'expired' | 'cancelled'
CREATE TABLE gym_invoices (id, group_id, booking_id, booking_ids TEXT, invoice_date, period_start, period_end, total_hours, rate, total_amount, notes, status, recurrence_id, created_at);
  -- booking_ids: JSON array of booking IDs for multi-date invoices (booking_id = NULL when set)
CREATE TABLE gym_recurrences (id, group_id, day_of_week, start_time, end_time, start_date, end_date, notes, status, created_at);
CREATE TABLE gym_blocked_dates (id, date, reason);
```

**Gym Rental Flow:**
- Groups get a private portal link (`/gym/book/:token`) — no login needed
- Renters select dates on a 6-month calendar and submit a hold request (holds only — no self-confirm)
- Admin reviews holds at `/gym-rentals`, confirms or releases individually or in bulk
- On confirmation: booking pushed to Google Calendar + one invoice per group emailed (Tithely pay link included)
- Multi-date requests produce one combined invoice listing all dates as line items

**Gym Admin Features (as of May 2026):**
- Dashboard grouped by org with checkboxes for bulk Confirm / Release / Delete
- "Confirm All" confirms all pending holds, grouped by org (one invoice per group)
- "Confirm Selected" / "Release Selected" — act on checked holds without page reload
- "Delete Selected" — bulk delete confirmed bookings
- Invoice view shows all dates when a multi-booking invoice
- Resend email re-sends the correct single/multi-booking invoice
- iCal feed at `/gym/cal/:token.ics` (admin-set token) for calendar subscriptions
- Blocked dates, recurring requests, group management all in the admin tab
- Rate configured in Settings tab (`gym_rate_per_hour`)
- Google Calendar integration via service account (secrets: `GCAL_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`, `GCAL_PRIVATE_KEY`, setting: `gcal_calendar_id`)

### Access Control
- Staff admin password: full access (News, Special Pages, Redirects, Newsletter, Gym Rentals)
- Youth director password: Youth Pages tab only (separate password so it can be changed independently)

## Church Content

### Identity
- **Full name:** Timothy Lutheran Church
- **Location:** Lindenwood Park, South City St. Louis
- **Denomination:** LCMS (mention once, quietly — not a focal point)

### Vision
> Planted Here. Sent Everywhere.
> Planted in culturally diverse St. Louis. Sent to the world as a congregation alive to the Gospel that breaks every wall — as we welcome every person, bear bold witness to the saving grace of God through Jesus, from our neighborhood to the nations.

### Mission
> Gathered Around Grace. Sent in Love.
> Timothy Lutheran Church is a congregation alive to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Gathered in worship around the Word and Sacraments of the risen Lord, we accept every person as one for whom Christ died. Growing in faith through Christian education and honest community, we go — from our neighborhood to the nations — bearing the tangible love of God to all.

### Core Values
1. **Worship** — Gathering as God's people, celebrating His grace, receiving His gifts of Word and Sacrament.
2. **Acceptance** — Intentionally welcoming and loving all people as Jesus does.
3. **Christian Education** — Equipping people for a lifelong journey with Christ.
4. **Outreach** — Sharing the love of Jesus with those who don't yet know Him.

### Mission Field
- **Lindenwood Park** — the neighborhood where God has planted us, our front door to the city of St. Louis.
- **Word of Life School** — families formed together through Lutheran education, community, and care.
- **Timothy's Mother's Day Out** — young families in their most open and searching season of life.

## Pending / Deferred Items

### Still Needs to Be Built
- **`/confirmation`, `/sundayschool`, `/vbs`, `/egghunt`, `/family`** — Youth sub-pages. Admin portal has the youth_pages table, but these slugs need content entered by the youth director.
- **Christmas Market annual content** — Page structure is built. Needs dates, description, photos, and Google Form link for vendors entered via the admin Ministries tab each year.
- **Prayer + Contact form delivery** — Confirm these forms send/deliver somewhere (email? DB?). Verify they're wired to a real endpoint.
- **Sermons page** — YouTube embed page exists; confirm it's pulling the correct channel or that it's manually maintained.

### Pinned / Low Priority
- **manual.html** — Keep this updated whenever new features, pages, or admin tabs are added. It is the staff reference guide at `/manual` and should always reflect the current state of the site and admin portal.
- **Newsletter Format 3** — Single-event announcement (date, time, location, RSVP). Skipped for now, add if needed.
- **R2 image uploads (card thumbnail)** — Body editors (TinyMCE) across News, Youth Pages, Pages, and Posts all have R2 upload fully wired via `tlcUploadHandler` — drag/drop or paste images and they upload automatically. The only remaining URL-only field is the News item card thumbnail (`image_url` text input). A file-picker button for that field could be added if needed.
- **KV-gate startup migrations** — ~130 D1 queries run on every admin request (no-ops after first deploy). Gate behind a KV schema-version key to reduce to 1 KV read per cold start. Low urgency.
- **Session idle timeout** — Admin sessions expire after 7 days fixed. Could add idle timeout (~24h) via a `last_activity` column on the sessions table.
- **EXIF metadata in uploaded images** — Staff photos uploaded via admin may contain GPS/device EXIF data. Consider documenting that staff should strip EXIF before uploading, or add Cloudflare Images processing.
- **Session idle timeout** — Admin sessions expire after 7 days fixed. Could add idle timeout (~24h) via a `last_activity` column on the sessions table.
- **Social preview image** — `og:image` currently uses the logo. A proper 1200×630 photo of the church/congregation would improve click-through when the site is shared on Facebook/Twitter. Drop a photo in `/public/images/` and update `og:image`, `twitter:image`, and `og:image:alt` in `public/index.html` head section.
- **Mobile touch targets** — do a tap-through on a real phone to verify button/link sizes feel comfortable, especially on ministry and youth sub-pages added since launch.

---

## CRITICAL: The Deployed File is `public/index.html`

Both `wrangler-site.toml` (production) and `wrangler-test-site.toml` (test) deploy from `./public/`.
The actual SPA is **`public/index.html`**. All HTML edits go there.

`timothystl-site.html` in the repo root no longer exists — it was deleted.

---

- Canonical URLs use `timothystl.org` (no www) consistently
- www → apex 301 redirect in `site-worker.js`
- noindex on /manual, /voters, /404

## Decisions Made (Do Not Re-litigate)

- Cloudflare Workers (not Netlify, Vercel, etc.) — already deployed and working
- No WordPress — too complex for this owner and the youth director
- Custom admin portal over Netlify CMS / Decap CMS — matches existing pattern in the repo
- D1 for dynamic content — already in use, keep consistent
- Cloudflare R2 for image uploads — planned for youth pages and news items
- `/newsevents` removed (use `/news`)
- LCMS mentioned once, quietly, on About page — not emphasized elsewhere
- WOL gets its own landing page (not a direct external redirect) — good for SEO and branding
- Christmas Market = Option B (admin-managed, not static)
- News and newsletter are separate systems (site news ≠ Beehiiv emails) — kept decoupled intentionally
